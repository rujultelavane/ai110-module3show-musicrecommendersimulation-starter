# 🎵 Music Recommender Simulation

## Project Summary

In this project you will build and explain a small music recommender system.

Your goal is to:

- Represent songs and a user "taste profile" as data
- Design a scoring rule that turns that data into recommendations
- Evaluate what your system gets right and wrong
- Reflect on how this mirrors real world AI recommenders

Replace this paragraph with your own summary of what your version does.

## How The System Works

Real-world recommenders (Spotify, YouTube) blend content-based filtering (matching an item's own attributes) with collaborative filtering (patterns from other users). This simulation has no other users, so it prioritizes content-based: it matches a song's own features directly against one listener's stated preferences, weighting genre and mood highest since they're the clearest signals in a small catalog.

**`Song` features used:** `genre`, `mood` (exact match), `energy` (distance to target), `acousticness` (checked against `likes_acoustic`).

**`UserProfile` stores:** `favorite_genre`, `favorite_mood`, `target_energy`, `likes_acoustic`.

### Algorithm Recipe

Each song is scored against the user's profile and the highest-scoring songs are returned.

| Signal | Rule | Points |
|---|---|---|
| Genre | Exact match: `song.genre == user.favorite_genre` | **+2.0** |
| Mood | Exact match: `song.mood == user.favorite_mood` | **+1.0** |
| Energy | Similarity to target, not exact match | **up to +2.0** |
| Acousticness | Checked against `likes_acoustic` | **±0.5** |

```
genre_score    = 2.0 if song.genre == user.favorite_genre else 0.0
mood_score     = 1.0 if song.mood  == user.favorite_mood  else 0.0
energy_score   = 2.0 * (1 - abs(song.energy - user.target_energy))

if user.likes_acoustic and song.acousticness >= 0.6:
    acoustic_score = +0.5
elif not user.likes_acoustic and song.acousticness <= 0.3:
    acoustic_score = +0.5
elif user.likes_acoustic and song.acousticness <= 0.3:
    acoustic_score = -0.5
elif not user.likes_acoustic and song.acousticness >= 0.7:
    acoustic_score = -0.5
else:
    acoustic_score = 0.0

total_score = genre_score + mood_score + energy_score + acoustic_score
```

Genre outweighs mood 2:1 because genre is a stable, category-level preference, while mood is more situational. Energy gets 2.0 max weight but decays with distance from the target. Acousticness is treated as a soft nudge (±0.5) rather than a deciding factor, since it's a secondary preference.

**Expected biases:** This system might over-prioritize genre and energy closeness, which means it can bury a song that's a near-perfect mood match but the "wrong" genre — even if that song is what the user actually wants to hear in the moment.

## Getting Started

### Setup

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate      # Mac or Linux
   .venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the app:

```bash
python -m src.main
```

### Running Tests

Run the starter tests with:

```bash
pytest
```

You can add more tests in `tests/test_recommender.py`.

## Sample Recommendation Output

User profile: `favorite_genre="indie pop"`, `favorite_mood="happy"`, `target_energy=0.75`, `likes_acoustic=False`

```
Loaded songs: 18

========================================
Top Recommendations
========================================

1. Rooftop Lights — Indigo Parade (4.98 pts)
   - genre match (+2.0)
   - mood match (+1.0)
   - energy similarity (+2.0)

2. Sunrise City — Neon Echo (3.36 pts)
   - mood match (+1.0)
   - energy similarity (+1.9)
   - acoustic match (+0.5)

3. Night Drive Loop — Neon Echo (2.50 pts)
   - energy similarity (+2.0)
   - acoustic match (+0.5)

4. Concrete Anthem — Trace Bars (2.36 pts)

## Experiments You Tried

Use this section to document the experiments you ran. For example:

- What happened when you changed the weight on genre from 2.0 to 0.5
- What happened when you added tempo or valence to the score
- How did your system behave for different types of users

## Limitations and Risks

Summarize some limitations of your recommender.

Examples:

- It only works on a tiny catalog
- It does not understand lyrics or language
- It might over favor one genre or mood

You will go deeper on this in your model card.

## Reflection

My biggest learning moment during this process is how simple it was to incorporate a recommendation system when you figure out a formula for the algorithm to follow. These simple algorithms still can feel like personalized recommendations because the code can provide reasons for certain recommendations, which can make it feel more human-like. If I extended this project I think I would incorporate UI so that it would not be CLI but rather with GUI.
